# InvestmentCalc
C++ program to calculate compounding interest

The program is an investment calculator designed to compute the final balance of an investment after a specified number of years. The calculator offers two modes of operation: 
Calculate the balance without any monthly deposits so the interest is compounded monthly on the initial investment amount for a defined number of years.
Calculate the balance with monthly deposits so the interest is compounded monthly on the total amount, including monthly deposits, for a defined number of years.
The program runs in a loop, prompting the user to choose an option, receive the necessary inputs, and then display the results year by year.
This calculator assists users in understanding their investments over time, either with or without monthly contributions. I separated the functions into individual methods (like calculating balance with or without monthly deposits) to allow for easier comprehension and debugging. The program could always be improved, for example one area could be the inclusion of more input validation techniques to handle negative interest rates or huge input values. The most challenging part was ensuring the loop validation statements were properly working. The skills of modular programming, input validation, and user input design are very useful and transferable.
